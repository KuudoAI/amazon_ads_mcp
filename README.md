## What Are MCP Tools?
Think of MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a translator between an AI model and outside systems (like Amazon Ads). Each MCP tool is like a remote control button that tells the AI how to interact with Amazon Ads. Without MCP tools, the AI would have no idea how to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to Amazon Ads.

With MCP tools:
* The AI knows the exact endpoints to call.
* The AI can request campaign reports, budgets, or targeting data safely.
* Everything is structured, so the AI doesn‚Äôt break things by making random guesses.

üëâ In short: MCP tools = a safe, well-labeled toolkit that lets AI work with the [Amazon Ads API](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us).

```bash
docker pull openbridge/amazon-ads-mcp
```

 Copy the environment template
 ```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit .env with your settings

Start the server with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The server will be available at http://localhost:9080

Check logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
Stop the server
```bash
docker-compose down
```

For full installation instructions, including verification, upgrading, and developer setup, see the [**Installation Guide**](INSTALL.md).

## Configuration
Amazon Ads requires that all calls to the API are authorized. If you are not sure what this means, you should read the Amazon docs:

* Amazon Ads API onboarding overview: https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/onboarding/overview
* Getting started with the Amazon Ads API: https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/get-started/overview

There are two paths for connecting to the API;
1. Bring Your Own App (BYOA)
2. Leverage Partner Apps

## Bring Your Own Amazon Ads API App
If you have your own Amazon Ads API app, or want to create one, the process is detailed below.

### 1. Register Your Application with Amazon

1. Go to the [Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/)
2. Create or select your Login with Amazon application
3. Note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
4. Set your callback URL to "Allowed Return URLs":
   - For production: `https://your-server.com/auth/callback`
   - For local development: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`


```bash
# Amazon Ads API Credentials (required)

export AMAZON_AD_API_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export AMAZON_AD_API_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"

# OAuth Server Configuration
export OAUTH_BASE_URL="https://your-server.com"  # Your server's public URL
# For local development: export OAUTH_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
export OAUTH_PROXY_REDIRECT_PATH=/auth/callback
```

### Complete Oauth Flow
To authroize your connection to Amazon, you need to complete an Oauth workflow. First, you need to set your region. Authorization occurs at the region level and not setting your region may cause a failure. The server will default to the `na` region. You can manually set the region with tool `set_active_region`.

* Tool: `set_active_region`
* Parameters: `na` | `eu` | `fe`

Example: *"Set my current region to `eu`"*

### Step 1: Start OAuth 

To connect to Amazon Ads API, you use an MCP tool to start your OAuth flow
* Tool: `start_oauth_flow`
* Example: *"Start my OAuth flow"*

<img src="images/step1.png" alt="Step 1" style="max-width: 600px;">

### Step 2: Redirect to Amazon Ads

In this example, you are prompted to click the link that will open a browser window and request approval at Amazon.

<img src="images/step2.png" alt="Step 2" style="max-width: 600px;">

### Step 3: Approve Request

In the browser window, Amazon will prompt that you approve the request to connect.

<img src="images/step3.png" alt="Step 3" style="max-width: 600px;">

### Step 4: Success

If all goes well, you will see a success response. You can close the brwser window and go back to your client. If you see something else, attempt the process again and confirm all your configuration elements are correct

<img src="images/step4.png" alt="Step 4" style="max-width: 600px;">


### Step 5: Confirmation

To confirm that your MCP server is connected to the Amazon Ads API, check your OAuth status

* Tool: `check_oauth_status`
* Example: *"Check my OAuth status"*

<img src="images/step5.png" alt="Step 5" style="max-width: 600px;">

### Partner Applications: Token Authentication
You can configure your client, like Claude, to use authentication by supplying a valid access token. This is most appropriate for service accounts, long-lived API keys, CI/CD, applications where authentication is managed separately, or other non-interactive authentication methods.

#### Openbridge Partner App
As an Ads API Partner application provider, Openbridge offers a ready-to-go gateway to the Amazon Ads API. You log into your Openbridge account, provision a token, then set your token in theyour client config (see below).

First, set Openbridge as the auth method:

```bash
AUTH_METHOD=openbridge
```

That is it for the server config. You configured the client, like Claude Desktop to pass the token directly.

Your Amazon authorizations reside in Openbridge. You first step in your client is to request your current identities: `"List my remote identities"`. Next, you would tell the MCP server to use of of these identities: `"Set my remote identity to <>"`. You can then ask the MCP to `List all of my Amazon Ad profiles` linked to that account. If you do not see an advertiser listed, set a different identity.


### Set Your Amazon Ads MCP Packages 
To activate, you need to set a comma-separated package to load. For example, to activate `profiles` and `amc-workflow`, set your package environment like this:
  - `AMAZON_AD_API_PACKAGES="profiles,amc-workflow"`

Here is the list of tool packages available in the server:

- `profiles`
- `campaign-manage`
- `accounts-manager-accounts`
- `accounts-ads-accounts`
- `accounts-portfolios`
- `accounts-billing`
- `accounts-account-budgets`
- `audiences-discovery`
- `reporting-version-3`
- `brand-benchmarks`
- `brand-metrics`
- `stores-analytics`
- `sponsored-products`
- `sp-suggested-keywords`
- `sponsored-brands-v4`
- `sponsored-brands-v3`
- `sponsored-display`
- `dsp-measurement`
- `dsp-advertisers`
- `dsp-audiences`
- `dsp-conversions`
- `dsp-target-kpi-recommendations`
- `amazon-attribution`
- `audience-insights`
- `partner-opportunities`
- `tactical-recommendations`
- `persona-builder`
- `creative-assets`
- `change-history`
- `data-provider-data`
- `data-provider-hashed`
- `products-metadata`
- `products-eligibility`
- `unified-pre-moderation-results`
- `moderation-results`
- `amazon-marketing-stream`
- `locations`
- `exports-snapshots`
- `marketing-mix-modeling`
- `reach-forecasting`
- `amc-administration`
- `amc-workflow`
- `amc-rule-audience`
- `amc-ad-audience`

You will note that some are broken up into smaller groupings. For example, Amazon Marketing Cloud has bundles; `amc-ad-audience`, `amc-administration`, `amc-rule-audience`, and `amc-workflow`. This is done to create efficiencies and optimizations that reduce conext limits in many AI clients. 

## Understanding Amazon Ads MCP Tools 

Amazon Ads MCP tools have prefixes (like `cp_` for Campaign Performance or `amc_` for Amazon Marketing Cloud) to help organize the specific Ads API operation.

Example prefixes:
- `cp_` ‚Üí campaign/advertising APIs  
- `amc_` ‚Üí AMC-related APIs  
- `dsp_` ‚Üí DSP APIs  
- `sd_` ‚Üí Sponsored Display  
- `ams_` ‚Üí Amazon Marketing Stream  

This will tranlate into collections of tools that align with the API operations that are available:

**Campaign Management (`cp_`)**
- `cp_listCampaigns` ‚Äî List all campaigns  
- `cp_getCampaign` ‚Äî Get specific campaign  
- `cp_createCampaign` ‚Äî Create new campaign  
- `cp_updateCampaign` ‚Äî Update campaign  
- `cp_archiveCampaign` ‚Äî Archive campaign  

**Sponsored Products (`sp_`)**
- `sp_listProductAds` ‚Äî List product ads  
- `sp_createKeywords` ‚Äî Create keywords  
- `sp_updateBids` ‚Äî Update keyword bids  
- `sp_getNegativeKeywords` ‚Äî Get negative keywords  

**AMC Workflows (`amc_`)**
- `amc_listWorkflows` ‚Äî List AMC workflows  
- `amc_executeWorkflow` ‚Äî Run workflow  
- `amc_getWorkflowStatus` ‚Äî Check workflow status  

Users would see tools like:

- **"List my Amazon Ads campaigns"**  
  ‚Üí Claude uses: `cp_listCampaigns`

- **"Create an AMC workflow"**  
  ‚Üí Claude uses: `amc_createWorkflow`

- **"Export my sponsored products ads data"**  
  ‚Üí Claude uses: `export_createAdExport`

## Advertiser Profiles & Regions

### Setting Your Advertiser Profile 
Per Amazon: *Profiles play a crucial role in the Amazon Ads API by determining the management scope for a given call. A profile ID is a required credential to access an advertiser's data and services in a specific marketplace.*

You many not know what profile(s)  authorization grants you access to. You can lists all advertising profiles accessible by your authroization:

* Tool: `ac_listProfiles`
* Example: *"List my advertiser profile ids"*

Response includes profile details:
- profileId, countryCode, currencyCode
- dailyBudget, timezone
- accountInfo (type: seller/vendor/agency)

Let's assume your list included profile ID `1043817530956285`. You can check for more details by get profile details to confirm this is the one you want to use.

* Tool: `ac_getProfile`    
* Example: *"Get the details for my profile_id: `1043817530956285`"*

Assuming this is the profile you want to use, you need to **set** the profile Amazon requires to API calls:
* Tool: `set_active_profile`
* Example: *"Set my active profile id to `1043817530956285`"*

When you set the profile, it determines:
- Which account's data you access
- Currency and timezone for reports
- Available campaigns/ads/keywords

The profile ID will be set in the background for the duration of your session. Repeat the process if you want to switch to a new profile.

Most calls to the Amazon Ads API require a Region. Each [advertiser profile ID](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/account-management/authorization/profiles) is associated with an advertising account in a specific region/marketplace. 

The region is part of an advertiser profile. When you set an advertiser profile with `set_active_profile`, it will set the region that is associated with the profile automatically.

* Tool: `set_active_profile`

Example: *"Set my active advertiser profile to `111111111111`"* 

Since profile ID `111111111111` is based in `na`, the region will be set based on the profile region.

### Set Active Region
The Amazon Ads MCP server includes tools for managing API regions as defaults and dynamically, allowing you to switch between North America (`na`), Europe (`eu`), and Far East (`fe`) regions without restarting the server.

| Region Code | Name | API Endpoint 
|------------|------|--------------|
| `na` | North America | https://advertising-api.amazon.com
| `eu` | Europe | https://advertising-api-eu.amazon.com
| `fe` | Far East | https://advertising-api-fe.amazon.com 

When you set a region, the system automatically:

1. **Updates API endpoints** - Routes API calls to the correct regional endpoint
2. **Updates OAuth endpoints** - Uses the correct token refresh endpoint for the region
3. **Clears cached tokens** - Ensures fresh authentication for the new region
4. **Preserves other settings** - Keeps profile ID and identity settings intact


**IMPORTANT: Avoid Region Mismatch**: *If you attempt to set a region that is not associated with you advertiser profile, the Ads API will reject your requests. For example if a profile ID is attached to `na` and you manually set the region to `eu`, you have created a mismatch which will cause API request failures.*

### Get Active Region
If you are not sure what region is set, you can check for the region
* Tool: `get_active_region`
* Returns: Current region, endpoints, and configuration source

Example: *"What is my current active region?"*

## Example MCP Client: Connect Claude Desktop

Navigate to Connector Settings

Open Claude in your browser and navigate to the settings page. You can access this by clicking on your profile icon and selecting ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù from the dropdown menu. Once in settings, locate and click on the ‚ÄúConnectors‚Äù section in the sidebar. This will display your currently configured connectors and provide options to add new ones.

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

In this example, we show how to use the bearer token using the Openbridge API key. Add this configuration to your `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amazon_ads_mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "--allow-http",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://${HOSTNAME}:${PORT}/mcp/",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENBRIDGE_REFRESH_TOKEN}",
        "--header",
        "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TIMEOUT": "300",
        "HOSTNAME": "your_hostname",
        "PORT": "your_server_port",
        "MCP_TIMEOUT": "120000",
        "MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT": "60000",
        "MCP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT": "10000",
        "MCP_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT": "60000",
        "MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT": "120000",
        "MCP_REQUEST_WARNING_THRESHOLD": "10000",
        "OPENBRIDGE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_openbridge_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Note**: Replace `hostname`, `port` and `your_openbridge_token_here` with your actual OpenBridge token.

Here is another exmaple, which can be used if you are using Oauth since the `OPENBRIDGE_REFRESH_TOKEN` is not needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amazon_ads_mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "http://localhost:9080/mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TIMEOUT": "120000",
        "MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT": "60000",
        "MCP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT": "10000",
        "MCP_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT": "60000",
        "MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT": "120000",
        "MCP_REQUEST_WARNING_THRESHOLD": "10000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the configuration file, restart Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server.



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Context Limits and Active MCP Server Tools
MCP tool registration and use can impact your AI systems usage limits. Usage limits control how much you can interact with a AI system, like Claude, over a specific time period. As Anthropic states, think of the amnount of information/data used goes draws down on a "conversation budget". That budget determines how many messages you can send to your AI client, or how long you can work, before needing to wait for your limit to reset.

MCP Server tools contribute metadata like titles, descriptions, hints, and schemas to the model's context. This metadata is loaded into the LLM‚Äôs context window, which acts as its short-term working memory.

Each client, like Claude, has a fixed-size context window. This defines the maximum amount of information it can process in a single interaction‚Äîincluding user prompts, system instructions, tool metadata, and any prior messages. 

The more tools you activate, the more of that limited space gets consumed up front. When you activate many tools, their combined schema and config payloads can significantly use up this context and you may quickly hit the context ceiling. This is when you‚Äôll start seeing errors or warnings about exceeding the chat length limit.

**The Amazon Ads MCP provides coverage across the entire API. As a result, there can be 100s of tools!**

* More tools = less room for user interaction: Activating unnecessary tools reduces available space for your actual prompt or data.
* Start small: Activate only what you need for the current task. You can always add more later.

If you're encountering unexpected length issues, review which tools are active. Trimming unused ones can help minimize context use.

## Troubleshooting

**Server not connecting?**
- Ensure the Docker container is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check server logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Verify the port is correct (8765 by default)

**Authentication errors?**
- Check your OpenBridge token is valid
- Ensure the token is properly set in the environment
- Verify your Amazon Ads API access

**Claude not recognizing the server?**
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
- Check the JSON syntax is valid
- Ensure the server name matches exactly
