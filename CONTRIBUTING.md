# Contributing to Amazon Ads MCP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Amazon Ads MCP! This document provides guidelines and best practices for contributing to this project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue:
1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use issue templates** - Select the appropriate template (Bug Report or Feature Request)
3. **Provide complete information** - Fill out all sections of the template
4. **Include reproduction steps** - For bugs, provide minimal steps to reproduce
5. **Add logs and error messages** - Include relevant debugging information

### Issue Best Practices

#### Writing Good Bug Reports
- **One issue per bug** - Don't combine multiple bugs in one issue
- **Be specific** - "Authentication fails" is better than "doesn't work"
- **Include environment details** - Python version, OS, MCP client version
- **Provide code samples** - Minimal reproducible examples help tremendously
- **Attach logs** - Include relevant error messages and stack traces

#### Writing Good Feature Requests
- **Explain the problem first** - What challenge does this solve?
- **Provide use cases** - Real-world examples help evaluate importance
- **Consider alternatives** - Have you tried other approaches?
- **Think about compatibility** - How does this affect existing users?

### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start
1. **Open an issue first** - Discuss your proposal before coding
2. **Check the roadmap** - Ensure it aligns with project direction
3. **One PR per feature/fix** - Keep changes focused and reviewable

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KuudoAI/amazon_ads_mcp.git
cd amazon_ads_mcp

# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set up pre-commit hooks (if available)
pre-commit install
```

#### Code Standards
- **Python 3.10+** - Use modern Python features appropriately
- **Type hints** - All functions should have type annotations
- **Docstrings** - Document all public APIs
- **Tests** - Add tests for new functionality
- **Linting** - Run `uv run ruff check --fix` before committing

#### Testing Requirements
```bash
# Run linting
uv run ruff check --fix

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific tests
uv run pytest tests/test_auth.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=amazon_ads_mcp
```
